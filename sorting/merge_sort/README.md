## Merge sort

Insertion sort has complexity O(n). https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/resources/mit6_006f11_lec03/


I could only think of a functional approach and I've used insertion sort to sort the two subarrays. The procedural one was adapted from CLRS Algorithms book which gives a more general solution and does not require 2 sorted arrays as input.
