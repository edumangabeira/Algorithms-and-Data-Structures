# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures


The purpose of this repository is to serve as a cookbook. Every algorithm will have a directory with a README file presenting its main applications, flaws and complexity. Each algorithm directory can have many exercises, but every exercise must be solved following two different approaches: functional and OOP.
